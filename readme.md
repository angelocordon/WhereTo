All the need-to-know stuff: weather, local news & events, image galleries - regarding cities all around the world displayed in a different manner.

This is a code test I'm doing to work on my front-end skills. The original [design](https://dribbble.com/shots/1081917-WhereTO-App/attachments/134531) is from Tiberiu Neamu.


### To Do
  + ~~Dump Bootstrap, implement Susy~~
  + ~~Come up with a blur effect solution for the Weather Forecast~~
  + ~~Navigation should be darkened unless active or on hover~~
  + ~~Background needs to cover fully~~
  + ~~Input field~~
  + Clean up Sass files to make responsive
  + Build into Chrome extension?
  + Use Ember(?)/React to change backgrounds based on city inputs
  + Actually implement a weather API
  + ~~Look into Flickr API for backgrounds~~
  + ~~Create a JS clock~~
  + ???
  + Profit

### Bugs
  + ~~(Clock) Getting a 12 hour clock to work. If the currentHours is over 12, it subtracts 12 from the currentHour. However, when it's 11 am, it's showing up as - 1 am.~~
  + (Flickr) Find a random picture each time based on the target_city
  + ~~(Flickr) Find pictures with original sizes only~~
